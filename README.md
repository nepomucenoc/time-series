# Time Series Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to perform a time series analysis. Time series are sets of observations collected over time. They are widely used in various fields, such as finance, economics, and meteorology, among others, to understand and forecast the behavior of data over time.

## Fundamental Concepts

Here are some essential concepts related to time series:

### 1. Time Series

* A time series is a set of observations or measurements taken at equally spaced intervals over time. These observations can represent a wide variety of phenomena, such as stock prices, temperature, and product sales, among others.

### 2. Components of a Time Series

* **Trend**: Represents the general direction of the data over time, indicating whether it is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.
* **Seasonality**: Refers to regular and predictable patterns that repeat in a fixed cycle. It can be daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.
* **Noise or Irregular Component**: These are non-systematic fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to trend or seasonality. They represent the unpredictable element of the time series.

### 3. Autocorrelation

* Autocorrelation is the correlation of a time series with itself at different points in time. It is an important measure to identify temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.

### 4. Stationarity

* A stationary time series is one in which statistical properties, such as mean and variance, do not significantly change over time. Stationarity is often an assumption in many time series analysis techniques.

### 5. Time Series Models

* There are several models for forecasting and analyzing time series. Some of the most common models include:
  * **Moving Average (MA) Model**: Uses moving averages of past values to predict future values.
  * **Autoregressive (AR) Model**: Uses past values of the series to predict future values.
  * **Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Model**: Combines elements of both moving averages and autoregression.
  * **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**: Combines autoregression, moving averages, and differences to make a time series stationary.
  * **Exponential Smoothing (ES) Model**: Used for forecasting time series with trend and seasonality.

### 6. Forecasting

* Time series forecasting involves estimating future values based on identified patterns in the time series. This can be done using statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, or hybrid methods.
